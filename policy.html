            </div>
            <div class="container-policy">
                <p>Your appointments are very important to Ami and it is reserved especially for you. I understand that sometimes schedules adjustments are necessary; therefore, I respectfully request at least 24 hours notice for cancellations.</p>
                <b><em>STRICT AND ENFORCED 24 HOUR CANCELLATION POLICY!</em></b>
                <p>Please understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, I miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time and clients on my waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. Since the services are reserved for you personally, a cancellation fee will apply.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Less than 24 hour notice will result in a charge equal to 50% of the reserved service amount.</li>
                    <li>"NO SHOWS" will be charged 100% of the reserved service amount.</li>
                    <li>Appointments made within the 24 hour period and need to cancel, the client must cancel within 4 hours of the appointment time or will result in a charge equal to 50% of the reserved service amount.</li>
                    <li>Multiple services not cancelled 24 hours in advance will be charged 100% of the reserved service amount. 50% of your multiple services may be charged to your credit card to reserve the appointment time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The cancellation policy allows me the the time to inform my standby guests of any availability, as well as keeping my schedule filled thus better serving everyone. Hair by Ami policies are presented and provided in the best quality and tradition of excellent servicing for our established and future clientele. Thenk you for viewing and supporting our plicies criteria.</p>
